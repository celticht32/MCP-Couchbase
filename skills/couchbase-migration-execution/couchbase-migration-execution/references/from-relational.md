PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server. The dominant challenge is not the data movement itself; it's the modeling shift from normalized relational tables to document model. This reference covers the execution side; for modeling guidance, see `couchbase-data-modeling`'s `migration-from-relational.md`.

## The fundamental difference from MongoDB migration

MongoDB → Couchbase is shape-preserving. Documents come out as JSON; documents go in as JSON.

Relational → Couchbase is shape-changing. You have rows in tables connected by foreign keys; you need documents that aggregate (or reference) related data based on access patterns.

This means **the transformation step is the bulk of the work** in relational migrations. Bulk loaders matter less; transformation logic matters more.

## Two execution patterns

### Pattern 1: ETL with re-modeling

1. Export each relational table to a flat file (CSV / JSON)
2. Write a transformation program that reads multiple files, joins them in memory or via the new model's logic, produces Couchbase-shaped JSON
3. Bulk load the JSON to Couchbase via cbimport

**When to use:** when the new document model differs substantially from the relational tables (denormalization, embedding, restructuring).

**Tooling:** custom Python/Go/Java script for transformation; OR Apache Nifi / Talend / Pentaho if you want a visual ETL designer.

### Pattern 2: CDC with transformation rules

1. Debezium reads the relational DB's transaction log
2. Streaming transformation (Kafka Streams, ksqlDB, or SMTs) reshapes the row-level events into document writes
3. Couchbase Kafka Connector writes to target

**When to use:** when you need ongoing sync (zero-downtime migration), AND the transformation is reasonably simple (row-to-document mostly 1:1, perhaps joining with one related table).

**Trade-off:** CDC handles the data-movement reliably, but complex transformations in the stream are hard. If you need to join 5 tables to make one document, CDC pipelines get awkward fast.

## Source-specific export

### PostgreSQL

**Full export of a table:**

```bash
psql -U postgres -d mydb \
    -c "\copy users TO '/tmp/users.csv' WITH CSV HEADER"
```

**Export to JSON (Postgres 9.2+ has JSON functions):**

```sql
\copy (SELECT row_to_json(t) FROM users t) TO '/tmp/users.jsonl';
```

**Pull related rows for a parent (for transformation):**

```sql
SELECT
    u.id, u.name, u.email,
    array_agg(o ORDER BY o.created_at DESC) AS recent_orders
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.user_id = u.id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.email;
```

This SQL itself produces a document-shaped result (users with embedded recent orders). Export, dump to JSON lines, cbimport.

### MySQL

**Full export:**

```bash
mysqldump --tab=/tmp mydb users
```

**Export to JSON via SELECT:**

```sql
SELECT JSON_OBJECT('id', id, 'name', name, 'email', email)
FROM users
INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/users.json';
```

MySQL's JSON_OBJECT function lets you shape rows into documents during the export.

### Oracle

**Data Pump export:**

```bash
expdp username/password \
    schemas=myschema \
    directory=DATA_PUMP_DIR \
    dumpfile=mydata.dmp
```

Data Pump exports to Oracle binary format. For Couchbase migration, you'll typically:
1. Use SQL*Plus to export tables to CSV
2. OR use a SQL client (DBeaver, etc.) that can export to JSON

### SQL Server

**bcp (bulk copy) export:**

```bash
bcp "SELECT * FROM mydb.dbo.users" queryout users.csv -c -t, -S server -U user -P password
```

**SSIS** can export to JSON natively for more complex transformations.

## Transformation patterns

Three common shapes for the transformation step:

### Shape 1: Direct row-to-doc

When the table maps cleanly to a collection:

```python
import csv, json

with open('users.csv') as f, open('users.jsonl', 'w') as out:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        doc = {
            "id": row["id"],
            "name": row["name"],
            "email": row["email"],
            "created_at": row["created_at"]
        }
        out.write(json.dumps(doc) + '\n')
```

Then `cbimport json --format lines --dataset file://users.jsonl --generate-key "user::%id%"`.

**Use for:** master/reference data, simple lookup tables, anything that's already document-shaped in the schema.

### Shape 2: Join multiple tables into one document

When the target document embeds related data:

```python
import json
from collections import defaultdict

# Read users
users = {}
with open('users.csv') as f:
    for row in csv.DictReader(f):
        users[row["id"]] = {"id": row["id"], "name": row["name"], "addresses": []}

# Read addresses, attach to users
with open('addresses.csv') as f:
    for row in csv.DictReader(f):
        if row["user_id"] in users:
            users[row["user_id"]]["addresses"].append({
                "street": row["street"], "city": row["city"]
            })

# Emit user documents
with open('users_with_addresses.jsonl', 'w') as out:
    for user in users.values():
        out.write(json.dumps(user) + '\n')
```

**Use for:** parent-with-children patterns where the children are bounded (addresses, settings, preferences).

**Caveat:** in-memory join works for moderate data. For TB-scale joins, use a real data engine (Spark, Snowflake, etc.) and emit the results as JSON.

### Shape 3: Multiple tables → multiple collections with references

When children are unbounded (one user has many orders), don't embed all of them — produce separate documents:

```python
# Users — one doc per user, optionally with a recent_orders summary
# Orders — one doc per order, with user_id reference

users = {}
order_counts = defaultdict(int)

with open('users.csv') as f:
    for row in csv.DictReader(f):
        users[row["id"]] = {"id": row["id"], "name": row["name"]}

with open('orders.jsonl', 'w') as out:
    with open('orders.csv') as f:
        for row in csv.DictReader(f):
            doc = {
                "id": row["id"],
                "user_id": row["user_id"],
                "total": float(row["total"])
            }
            out.write(json.dumps(doc) + '\n')
            order_counts[row["user_id"]] += 1

# Add denormalized count to user docs (read-optimization)
for uid, user in users.items():
    user["order_count"] = order_counts.get(uid, 0)

with open('users.jsonl', 'w') as out:
    for user in users.values():
        out.write(json.dumps(user) + '\n')
```

Then load both files into separate collections.

**Use for:** one-to-many relationships where the "many" side is unbounded. Create a secondary index on `user_id` in the orders collection so you can efficiently query "all orders for user X."

## Handling SQL-specific features

### Auto-increment / sequences

Relational DBs auto-generate IDs. Couchbase doesn't (well, there are counters via `cb_mutate_in` increment, but they're a write hotspot).

**Options:**
1. **Keep the existing IDs** — use the relational ID as the Couchbase key suffix: `user::42`, `user::43`. Works fine for read-side compatibility
2. **Switch to ULIDs going forward** — old data keeps numeric IDs, new data gets ULIDs. Document this clearly
3. **Re-key everything to ULIDs** — clean but breaks any external references to old IDs

For most migrations, option 1 is right: keep the IDs to preserve referential integrity from logs, third-party systems, etc.

### Foreign keys

In the target document model, foreign keys become either:
- **Embedded data** — for 1:1 or bounded 1:few relationships
- **Reference fields** — store the foreign key value as a field; query via secondary index

There's no FK enforcement in Couchbase. The application is responsible for referential integrity.

### NULL handling

SQL has NULL as a distinct value; JSON doesn't quite. Three options:

1. **Omit the field entirely** when null in SQL: `if row['email']: doc['email'] = row['email']`
   - Pro: smaller documents, cleaner
   - Con: queries need `IS MISSING` checks
2. **Set to JSON `null`:** `doc['email'] = row['email'] or None`
   - Pro: explicit
   - Con: takes space; field semantics are "we know this is null" vs "we don't have this field"
3. **Use sentinel values:** `doc['email'] = row['email'] or ""`
   - Pro: simpler queries
   - Con: loses the null/missing distinction

Pick one and apply consistently. Option 1 is most idiomatic for Couchbase.

### Stored procedures

SQL stored procedures don't translate directly. Options:
- **Move logic to application code** — most stored procs are business logic that should be in services anyway
- **Use Eventing functions** — server-side JS reacting to document changes (see `couchbase-mcp`)
- **Use N1QL UDFs** — JavaScript functions usable in queries

Migration is a good time to extract proc logic; long-term it should be in code.

### Views

Materialized views or denormalized query helpers in SQL translate to:
- **Materialized summary documents** maintained by Eventing functions
- **N1QL queries** computed at read time (if cost is acceptable)
- **Couchbase Analytics service** for OLAP-style ad-hoc views

### Triggers

Relational triggers (insert/update hooks) map directly to Couchbase Eventing functions: server-side JavaScript that reacts to document mutations. Same conceptual model, different syntax.

## Validation challenges specific to relational

The trickiest validation: confirming that a multi-table aggregation in SQL gives the same result as a multi-document join in N1QL.

**Approach:**
1. Pick a representative aggregation in the source (e.g., "total revenue per customer last month")
2. Run it in SQL on the source
3. Run the equivalent N1QL on Couchbase
4. Compare results

Differences usually mean:
- Modeling didn't capture some relationship correctly (missing FK in the document)
- Edge case in NULL handling
- Date/timestamp format differences
- One side has data the other doesn't (incomplete migration)

## CDC for relational sources

Debezium covers most relational sources well:

| Source | Debezium connector |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | `debezium-connector-postgres` — uses logical replication. Requires `wal_level = logical` on the source |
| MySQL | `debezium-connector-mysql` — reads binlog. Requires binlog enabled with `ROW` format |
| Oracle | `debezium-connector-oracle` — uses LogMiner. Extra licensing / setup |
| SQL Server | `debezium-connector-sqlserver` — uses CDC feature. Must be enabled on source DB |

**The transformation challenge in streaming:**

Debezium emits per-row events. If your Couchbase document combines fields from multiple rows (joined data), the CDC pipeline needs to handle that. Options:

1. **Stream-table join in Kafka Streams** — maintain a state store of one table, stream-join the other
2. **Two separate sinks** — load tables individually into Couchbase as separate collections; the application joins at query time
3. **Periodic batch reconciliation** — CDC keeps the basic data in sync; a separate batch job rebuilds aggregated documents periodically

For complex transformations, option 2 (separate collections + N1QL join) is often the right answer despite the runtime cost.

## Two execution paths in detail

### Path A: Big-bang with ETL

```
[Postgres] --pg_dump--> [CSV/JSON files] --transform-->  [docs.jsonl]  --cbimport--> [Couchbase]
                                                                                          ^
                                                            [Validation queries] ---------+
```

**Timeline:** weeks for moderate scale. The transform step is where time goes.

### Path B: CDC with eventual model alignment

```
[Postgres] --Debezium--> [Kafka topics, one per table] --> [Couchbase Kafka Connector] --> [Couchbase]
                                                                                              ^
                                                            [Eventing functions to aggregate] +
```

**Timeline:** weeks for tooling setup, then ongoing. The Eventing functions emit aggregated documents based on individual row events.

## Quick decision tree

- **One-shot migration, modest scale, modeling change required?** → ETL: pg_dump/mysqldump + transformation script + cbimport
- **Zero-downtime, simple row-to-doc shape?** → Debezium + Couchbase Kafka Connector
- **Zero-downtime, complex aggregation needed?** → Debezium + Eventing functions for aggregation (or batch reconciliation)
- **Large scale, Spark already available?** → Spark migration: read JDBC, transform, write Couchbase via Spark Connector
- **Source has complex stored procedures?** → Extract business logic to app code before migrating (migration is a good catalyst for this work)
- **NULL handling?** → Omit fields when null (idiomatic Couchbase); use `IS MISSING` in queries
- **Foreign keys?** → Embed when bounded; reference + secondary index when unbounded
- **Sequences / auto-increment IDs?** → Keep them for backwards compatibility; switch to ULIDs for new data going forward
