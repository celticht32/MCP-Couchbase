# Couchbase MCP Server

[![SafeSkill 91/100](https://img.shields.io/badge/SafeSkill-91%2F100_Verified%20Safe-brightgreen)](https://safeskill.dev/scan/celticht32-mcp-couchbase)
A Python MCP (Model Context Protocol) server exposing the **full Couchbase data-plane and admin REST API** as tools for AI assistants like Claude.

---

## Status — substantially hardened

This server has been hardened across **seven phases** beyond the original tool surface. The tool catalogue and category breakdown below describe the original baseline; the live state is **164 tools across 16 handler modules with 223 unit tests**.

Highlights of what's been added:

- **Safety primitives** — read-only mode by default, destructive-tool confirmation gate, MCP `ToolAnnotations` on every tool, SQL++ DML detection, index DDL validation.
- **Engineering fixes** — HTTP retries with exponential backoff, unified admin REST client, structured `err()` responses, cluster version detection with caching.
- **Auth & transport** — mTLS support, Streamable HTTP transport in addition to stdio.
- **Diagnostics** — `cb_get_schema_for_collection`, `cb_index_advisor`, `cb_explain_query` with parsed findings, query performance analyzers.
- **Couchbase 8.x first-class tools** — hyperscale and composite vector index helpers, user lock/unlock, temporary passwords, XDCR conflict log readback, per-user query stats. All gated to 8.x via `_require_8x()`.
- **KV durability and subdocument ops** — optional `durability`/`expiry_seconds`/`cas` on existing CRUD tools (backwards-compatible), plus `cb_lookup_in` / `cb_mutate_in` for per-path reads and atomic mutations.
- **Multi-document transactions** — `cb_transaction_run` wrapping `cluster.transactions.run` with a serialized op list (write-batch pattern).
- **Analytics, Backup/Restore, Eventing** service surfaces.
- **FTS synonym set documents** (8.x) with schema validation.
- **DARE / KMIP** configuration tools.
- **Capella v4 control plane** read-only tools — separate auth (Bearer token), separate base URL (`cloudapi.cloud.couchbase.com`), 16 read-only tools across organizations / projects / clusters / users / allowlists / API keys / app services.

**See [`CHANGES.md`](./CHANGES.md) for the complete per-phase narrative**, the full tool list with classification, environment variables, breaking-change notes (there are none — all additions are strictly additive), and known caveats including REST-path assumptions that haven't been validated against every Couchbase patch level.

The skill packs for Claude — `couchbase-7x` and `couchbase-8x` — guide an LLM through using these tools correctly. Each has a `references/new-tools.md` that catalogs additions since the original skill release.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CB_CONNECTION_STRING` | `couchbase://localhost` | Use `couchbases://` for TLS |
| `CB_USERNAME` | `Administrator` | |
| `CB_PASSWORD` | `password` | |
| `CB_BUCKET` | `default` | Default bucket for data ops |
| `CB_SCOPE` | `_default` | |
| `CB_COLLECTION` | `_default` | |
| `CB_MGMT_PORT` | `8091` | Capella: use `18091` |

### 3. Register with Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchbase": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/couchbase-mcp-server/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "CB_CONNECTION_STRING": "couchbase://localhost",
        "CB_USERNAME": "Administrator",
        "CB_PASSWORD": "password",
        "CB_BUCKET": "travel-sample"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop — all 75+ tools appear automatically.

## Example Prompts

```
List all buckets and show memory usage for each.
Create a bucket called "sessions" with 256MB RAM, ephemeral type.
Add a user "app_reader" with read-only access to travel-sample.
Show me which nodes are in the cluster and their service assignments.
Create a GSI index on the `email` field of users._default._default.
Set up XDCR replication from travel-sample to my DR cluster at 10.1.0.5.
Show current rebalance progress.
List all FTS indexes and their document counts.
Get the last 20 system events from the cluster log.
```

## Requirements
Python version
Python 3.10 or higher is required. The binding constraint is the mcp package itself — it declares requires_python >= 3.10. The code also uses list[Tool] and dict as generic type hints directly (PEP 585), but every handler file includes from __future__ import annotations which backports that syntax to 3.8+. Without that annotation import the syntax would require 3.9+. In practice 3.10 is the floor.

pip packages
MCP server (requirements.txt):
PackageVersionWhymcp>=1.0.0MCP server framework — Server, stdio_server, Tool, TextContentcouchbase>=4.2.0Couchbase Python SDK — used for CRUD, N1QL, FTS data-plane tools
GUI server (install separately):
PackageVersionWhyflaskany recentREST bridge between browser and MCP handlersflask-corsany recentCORS headers so the SPA can call the API
bashpip install mcp>=1.0.0 couchbase>=4.2.0          # MCP server
pip install flask flask-cors                       # GUI only

Standard library only (no extra install needed)
The admin REST API tools use only Python built-ins — urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error, base64, json, os, asyncio, typing — so the HTTP side has zero extra dependencies beyond what ships with Python.

Couchbase server compatibility
The couchbase SDK >=4.2.0 targets Couchbase Server 7.0+ and Couchbase Capella. The apply_profile("wan_development") call in shared.py relaxes timeouts for remote/cloud connections and was added in SDK 4.1, so 4.2+ covers it cleanly

## Notes

- **Admin tools** call the Couchbase Management REST API (port 8091) via HTTP — no extra SDK needed beyond the Python SDK already installed.
- **Data tools** use the Couchbase Python SDK with lazy connection initialization.
- For **Couchbase Capella**, set `CB_CONNECTION_STRING=couchbases://...` and `CB_MGMT_PORT=18091`.
- Destructive operations (delete bucket, flush, hard failover) are explicit tools — Claude will ask for confirmation in context before acting.
