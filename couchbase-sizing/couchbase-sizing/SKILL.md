# Couchbase sizing & capacity planning

A skill for *numerical* planning of Couchbase deployments. Companion to `couchbase-mcp` (which operates clusters) and `couchbase-data-modeling` (which designs the data shape) — this skill answers "how much" and "how many."

## When this skill applies

Use this skill whenever the conversation involves estimating resources or capacity:

- "How much RAM do I need?"
- "How many nodes for X documents?"
- "Which Capella tier should I use?"
- "Will this fit in 32 GB?"
- "Should I scale up or scale out?"
- "How big will the index be?"
- "What replica count?"
- "Sizing for vector search"
- "How much XDCR bandwidth"
- "Capacity for next year's growth"

If the conversation is about *what* to store (modeling), use `couchbase-data-modeling`. If it's about *how to* operate (calling tools), use `couchbase-mcp`. This skill is purely about resource math.

## Pick the right reference

| Question | Read |
|---|---|
| "How much RAM / what's the working set?" | `references/memory.md` |
| "How many nodes? What replica count?" | `references/nodes.md` |
| "How much disk / storage?" | `references/disk.md` |
| "Network bandwidth, XDCR throughput?" | `references/network.md` |
| "How big will the GSI / FTS / vector index be?" | `references/indexes.md` |
| "Which Capella tier?" | `references/capella.md` |
| "Read-heavy vs write-heavy vs vector vs time-series sizing?" | `references/workload-shapes.md` |

## What you need from the user before sizing anything

Sizing math depends on workload data. Without these inputs, the best you can do is order-of-magnitude estimates with explicit assumptions. **Ask the user for any of these that aren't already in context:**

1. **Document count** at present, and expected growth rate (per month or year)
2. **Average document size** (and if it varies a lot, the 95th percentile too)
3. **Reads per second** (peak, not average — sizing is for peak)
4. **Writes per second** (peak)
5. **Working set assumption**: what fraction of documents are "hot" (accessed regularly)? Common: 20%, 50%, 100%
6. **Replica count target** (usually 1 or 2)
7. **Services needed** (Data, Query, Index, FTS, Eventing, Analytics, Backup, Search)
8. **TTL / retention** (does data age out?)

If the user doesn't have these numbers, give them a way to estimate. Most users underestimate document count and document size.

## The core sizing equation

A first-cut RAM estimate for the Data service:

```
RAM_per_node = (working_set_size + metadata_overhead) × (1 + replica_count)
             ÷ node_count
             + overhead_for_other_services
             + 20% headroom
```

Where:
- `working_set_size` = `document_count × avg_doc_size × working_set_fraction`
- `metadata_overhead` ≈ `document_count × 56 bytes` (Couchbase per-doc metadata)
- `overhead_for_other_services` depends on which services are on the same node

`memory.md` walks through this with worked examples.

## Three rules of thumb

**Rule 1 — Working set is what matters, not total data size.**
Couchbase keeps the working set in RAM; cold data lives on disk and pages in on demand. For most workloads, working set is 20-50% of total data size. If you size for 100% of data to fit in RAM, you're typically over-provisioning by 2-5x.

**Rule 2 — Always plan for one node failure.**
With replica count = 1, losing one node means the cluster has to absorb that node's load on the remaining nodes. Size so the post-failure cluster still has 20%+ headroom.

**Rule 3 — Add 20% headroom on every estimate.**
Compaction, rebalance, traffic spikes, monitoring overhead. The textbook number you calculate is the cluster running comfortably; reality involves slack.

## Scale up vs scale out

Couchbase scales horizontally well, so the default answer is usually "scale out" (add more smaller nodes). But scale-up has its place:

| Scale UP (bigger nodes) | Scale OUT (more nodes) |
|---|---|
| Higher per-node throughput for read-heavy KV | Better fault tolerance |
| Simpler ops (fewer machines to manage) | Better for write-heavy workloads (more parallel writes) |
| Cheaper per-GB at higher tiers | Better headroom (lose one of N=10 vs one of N=3) |
| Limited by max node spec | Limited only by cluster-wide overhead at >100 nodes |

**Default:** start with the smallest number of nodes that meets your fault-tolerance bar (3-node minimum for replica=1, 4+ for replica=2), then scale out as load grows.

## Service mix on nodes

Couchbase nodes can run any combination of services: Data, Query, Index, FTS, Eventing, Analytics, Backup, Search. Three common deployment patterns:

**Pattern: all-services on every node.** Simplest. Each node runs everything. Good for small clusters (< 5 nodes) where dedicated service nodes would be wasteful.

**Pattern: Data nodes + Query/Index nodes.** Most common at moderate scale. Separate the data plane (KV-heavy, latency-sensitive) from the query plane (CPU-heavy, can absorb bursts). 3 data nodes + 2 query/index nodes is a common starting shape.

**Pattern: dedicated nodes per service.** Production at scale. Data nodes do nothing but data. Index nodes are RAM-heavy. Analytics nodes have their own boxes entirely (they're storage-heavy). Eventing has its own pool sized to function memory + concurrency.

`nodes.md` covers the math for picking the mix.

## Capella vs self-managed sizing differences

For Capella, sizing translates to tier selection:

- The smallest free-tier cluster is enough for development and small staging
- Production tiers come in pre-sized configurations (e.g., 4 vCPU / 16 GB RAM, 16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM, etc.)
- You pick the tier per node and the node count separately
- Storage, network, and replication are managed by Capella — you don't size them directly

`capella.md` has the current tier breakpoints and which one to pick for what workload size.

For self-managed, you control everything: CPU, RAM, disk, network. All references apply.

## Common mistakes to flag

When the user proposes a size, check for these:

- **Sizing for total data, not working set** — typically 2-5x over-provisioned
- **Forgetting replicas** — `replica=1` doubles the storage and RAM requirement for the data
- **No headroom for node failure** — if N=3 and one fails, the remaining 2 absorb 150% of normal load
- **Ignoring index memory** — GSI indexes use RAM; vector and FTS indexes are RAM-heavy. Plan for them as a separate budget
- **Mixing service types without budget** — Data, Query, and Index on the same node compete for RAM; explicit budgets are needed
- **Sizing for steady-state without considering burst** — a Black Friday e-commerce site needs 3-5x the steady-state capacity
- **Forgetting growth** — sizing for today means re-sizing in 6 months; size for 12-18 months projected
- **Ignoring rebalance overhead** — a rebalance moves data while the cluster is under normal load. Need to leave I/O and CPU slack for it
